    "name": "Sig Anderman",
    "title": "Retired Founder, CEO and Chairman of Ellie Mae, former Founder and CEO, American HomeShield",
    "bio": "Sig Anderman Professional Career\nSigmund (Sig) Anderman is an American businessman and philanthropist. He was born in New York City in 1941 and attended New York public schools, graduating from City College of New York with a B.S. in Education in 1962. He obtained his J.D. (LLB) degree from New York University in 1965. After law school, Sig worked for the law firm of Winer, Neuburger and Sive (now Sive, Paget and Reisel), a New York law firm specializing in corporate and environmental law. For many years, Sig was, along with his partner, David Sive, part of the legal team handling the pioneering lawsuits that energized and defined the environmental movement in America. Among the many landmark cases Anderman participated in was Scenic Hudson Preservation Conference v. Federal Power Commission (1971). The Scenic Hudson (“Storm King Mountain”) case, for the first time in American jurisprudence, gave standing to bring a lawsuit to a citizens group without a financial interest in the project. The project proponent, Con Edison, eventually abandoned the project. Another notable case was Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Inc. v. Schlesinger (1971), argued before the U.S. Supreme Court – on a Saturday, for only the second time in the history of the Court. That case, which sought to enjoin the government’s testing of a nuclear bomb under Amchitka Island, Alaska was eventually lost, but brought widespread public attention to the issues and risks of underground nuclear bomb testing and its potential environmental damage.\nIn 1979, Sig changed careers, becoming Chief Executive Officer of American Home Shield Corporation, the pioneering home warranty company that he helped found in 1973. That move spawned an entrepreneurial career spanning four decades and four innovative startup companies. After American Home Shield was sold in 1982 (still the dominant home warranty company in the country), Sig started CompuFund, Inc., a computerized mortgage origination company, founded in 1982; and Inspectech, Inc., a computerized home inspection service, founded in 1992.\nIn 1998, Sig founded Ellie Mae, Inc., now the country’s leading provider of automation software for the mortgage industry. He was president and Chief Executive Officer of Ellie Mae from 1998 to 2015, and until April 2019 was Executive Chairman of the Board. Ellie Mae’s digital mortgage solution enables banks, credit unions and mortgage lenders to originate more loans, lower origination costs and reduce the time to close, all while ensuring the highest levels of compliance, quality and efficiency. The Company is headquartered in Pleasanton, California, employs 1,500 people nationwide, and serves over 3,000 lenders and mortgage brokers who use the company’s software to originate and fund approximately 40 percent of all residential mortgages in the United States. Ellie Mae has been recognized as not only one of the best performing and fastest growing companies in its industry, in the software business, among all companies in the United States (Fortune’s 100 Fastest Growing Companies in 2017) and on the New York Stock Exchange (“ELLI”), but also as one of the best places to work in the San Francisco Bay Area (San Francisco and Silicon Valley Business Times top 20) and the United States (Glassdoor Top 40). In 2019, Ellie Mae was purchased by private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $3.7 Billion.\nAnderman was named one of the “Ten Most Influential People in the Mortgage Industry” in 2005, named an Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award Finalist in 2014, and received the Distinguished Career Award from the Executive Roundtable for Mortgage Finance in 2019. He is the subject of several books and articles relating to entrepreneurship, including The Eight Patterns of Highly Effective Entrepreneurs by New York Times’ writer Brent Bowers, Small Business Growth Strategies, and Leadership Plans for CEOs: Top CEOs on Building a Team, Achieving Goals and Delivering Value,” by Aspatore, and Tom Peters’ “Re-Imagine!: Business Excellence in a Disruptive Age,” and the 2005 Tom Peters’ PBS Special on Business Excellence and Innovation.\nPhilanthropy\nSig Anderman is Chairman of the Anderman Family Foundation, a San Francisco philanthropy he established to support environmental protection, the arts, medical research and social justice initiatives. He is founder and Chairman of The Springboard Initiative, a non-profit organization that provides underserved, minority young people innovative training programs and placement in high tech jobs. Anderman also serves on the Board of Directors of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.\nPersonal life\nSig married Susan Kosarin Anderman in 1964. She died in 2017 after 52 years of marriage. He has 3 children: Elissa Anderman VanDeursen, David Anderman and Gabrielle Anderman Cale, and 6 grandchildren.",
